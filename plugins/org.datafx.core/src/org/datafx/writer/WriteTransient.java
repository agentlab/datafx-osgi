 * Annotation that indicates that a change in a particular field should <b>not</b> be considered

 * <pr>
 * In the case writeBack support is enabled, all changes in javafx properties on the resulting
 * entity(ies) will lead to a writeback operation. In some cases, this is not desirable. 
 * Adding the WriteTransient annotation to one or more fields in the class definition of the
 * resulting object will prevent changes to propagate to the original datasource.
