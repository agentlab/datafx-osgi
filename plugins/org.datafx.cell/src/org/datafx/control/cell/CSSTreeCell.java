/**
 * Convenience extension to the {@link TreeCell} class to expose a basic
 * CSS implementation (whilst the real JavaFX implementation is in
 * development). The only methods that should be used are {@link #getCssState(List)}
 * and {@link #stateChanged(String, String...)}. Refer to these methods
 * for more information on how to use them in your custom cells.
 *
 * @author <a href="http://www.jonathangiles.net">Jonathan Giles</a>
 * @param <T> The type of the item contained within the cell.
 */
public class CSSTreeCell<T> extends TreeCell<T> {
    /**
     * Override this method to specify which pseudo class states the
     * cell is in, based on the {@link #itemProperty() item} that is
     * currently contained within it. For example, the {@link MoneyCellFactory}
     * implementation of this method might resemble the following:
     *
     * <pre>
     * &#064;Override public void getCssState(List<String> s) {
     *     Number n = getItem();
     *     if (n == null) return;
     *
     *     double value = n.doubleValue();
     *
     *     if (value < 0) s.add("negative");
     *     if (value > 0) s.add("positive");
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * Doing this, it is now posible to style the cell based on these
     * psuedo class states. For example, assuming the {@link MoneyCellFactory}
     * had a style class of 'money-cell' (which it does), you could then
     * have CSS along the lines of the following:
     *
     * <pre>
     * .money-cell:positive {
     *   -fx-text-fill: green;
     * }
     * .money-cell:negative {
     *   -fx-text-fill: red;
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * This CSS results in positive values being green, and negative values
     * being red. By exposing the pseudo class states in CSS, it is possible
     * for the cell to be totally styled using CSS. This makes it trivial to
     * reuse the cell with an entirely different look.
     *
     * @param s A {@link List} of Strings which represent the current state
     * of the cell. It is legal to add further strings to the list, to
     * specify further states.
     */

     * method when the item changes, and therefore the state of the cell has
     * changed. The strings passed to this method should be the same as those
     * that are provided via {@link #getCssState(List) getCssState}.
     *
     * <p>Only call this method using the strings of states that have actually
     * changed. For example, when the MoneyCell changes from being negative to
