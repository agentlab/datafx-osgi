/**
 * <p>
 * Annotation for a FXML controller. This annotation will define the FXML-file
 * this controller is made for. You don't need to use this annotation because
 * the API is designed using a convention over configuration approach: If you
 * have a fxml file "master.fxml" you can create a MasterController.java
 * controller in the same package and the controller API will use this
 * controller for the fxml. To create a controller/view pair you need to use the
 * {@link #ViewFactory}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An example of a simple controller:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * {@literal @}FXMLController("Details.fxml")
 * public class DetailViewController {
 *
 * 	{@literal @}FXML
 *  private TextField myTextfield;
 *   
 *	{@literal @}FXML
 *  private Button backButton;
 *   
 *  {@literal @}PostConstruct
 *  public void init() {
 *  	myTextfield.setText("Hello!");
 *  }
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
